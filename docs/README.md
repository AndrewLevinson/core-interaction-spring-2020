<!-- ## Class Details

### Studio

The course is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the Internet as creative platform—where did it come from, how does it work, how do you make things for it, and what do you want to say? We will critically examine the web from many angles and we will learn how to turn it upside-down based on our needs as a designers, writers, artists and coder.

We will conduct an extensive investigation into the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects, undertaking comprehensive research and directing their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. We will work from an open-ended definition of interactivity: any reciprocal action between two or more parties. With this definition, what a website looks like and how it can function opens up.

Students will learn foundational, front-end languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to produce creative content for web distribution. Students are required to come to class prepared with questions and concerns. This is not a tutorial class. We, all together, will use the class time to solve problem-based questions. Each student is expected to work autonomously at home. There will be a lot of making this semester, both in class and out, and you will be coding everything from scratch.

### Lab

This course serves as a complement to Core Studio Interaction. The assignments are built to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML and CSS. -->
