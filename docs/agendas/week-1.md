     <blockquote>Every class will begin with a student presenting on a public website they find interesting. The student is expected to facilitate a discussion with the class to dig into how the site was built. Explanations and outstanding questions are expected. These will begin begin in our Week 3 class meeting on Feb 7th. Post your submission on your Github page prior to your week.</blockquote>

1. Add structure (HTML) and style (CSS) to your course index page hosted on Github Pages. You should find a creative but logical way to organize the content you create throughout Core Interaction. You will maintain this page thoughout the entire semester, so it doesn't need to be perfect just yet. Just make sure <i>_something_</i> is published by next class.
