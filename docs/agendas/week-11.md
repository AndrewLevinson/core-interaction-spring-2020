- Meeting on Zoom, [at the usual link here](https://NewSchool.zoom.us/j/6890998105)
  - I highly encourage you to join live, but if you are in a very different timezone, you can watch the recording on your own time. I will send out the link to the recording after class ends and post it here

### Homework

- Using [the starter code here](-disabled), make this layout flexible. Ensure it works nicely at browser widths of `375px`, `1024px`, and `1440px`
  - Use a combination of CSS `@media` queries and `window.innerWidth` in JavaScript
- I will grade the first two JavaScript homeworks (the button and filter) as well as your Canvas discussion post this weekend.
