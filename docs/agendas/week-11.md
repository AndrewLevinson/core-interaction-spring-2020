### Homework

- Using [the starter HTML code here](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato/tree/master/lab/week-11/starter.html), layout this site in three unique ways. Ensure it works differently and nicely at browser widths of `375px`, `1024px`, and `1440px`
  - Use a combination of `@media` queries in CSS and conditional logic with `if` statements in JavaScript
  - You can play around with the starter HTML a little bit if you'd like, but it <b>must be the same HTML file for all three breakpoints</b>
  - Remember to create your own CSS file called "style.css" and JavaScript file called "script.js". The code to link them is already in the HTML
- I will grade the first two JavaScript homeworks (the button and filter) as well as your Canvas discussion post this weekend.

<b>Due Date:</b> Uploaded to your Github repo and accessible via a link on your course homepage by next lab, April 17
