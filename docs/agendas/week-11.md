- Meeting on Zoom, [at the usual link here](https://NewSchool.zoom.us/j/6890998105)
  - I highly encourage you to join live, but if you are in a very different timezone, you can watch the recording on your own time. I will send out the link to the recording after class ends and post it here
- [Lesson Link - Responsive Design, Part 1](../lessons/lab/lesson-11)
- I will upload our lesson code at the usual repo, [here](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato/tree/master/lab/week-11)

### Homework

- Using [the starter HTML code here](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato/tree/master/lab/week-11/starter.html), layout this site in three unique ways. Ensure it works differenlty and nicely at browser widths of `375px`, `1024px`, and `1440px`
  - Use a combination of `@media` queries in CSS and conditional logic with `if` statements in JavaScript
- I will grade the first two JavaScript homeworks (the button and filter) as well as your Canvas discussion post this weekend.
