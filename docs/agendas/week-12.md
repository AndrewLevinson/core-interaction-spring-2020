### Homework

- Build on your responsive homework assignment from last week. Ensure it works differenlty and nicely at browser widths of `375px`, `1024px`, and `1440px`
  - Use the `<picture>` element to serve differently sized images at the three breakpoints
  - Use the `pointer:course` media query to detect touch devices.
    - Assume the `1440px` breakpoint uses a mouse, and the `375px` and `1024px` breakpoints are an iPhone and iPad
- <i>will update with more specifics by class friday</i>

<b>Due Date:</b> Uploaded to your Github repo and accessible via a link on your course homepage by next lab, April 24
