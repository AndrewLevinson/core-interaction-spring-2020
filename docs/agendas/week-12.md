### Homework

- Build on your responsive homework assignment from last week. Ensure it continues to work differenlty and nicely at browser widths of `375px`, `1024px`, and `1440px`
  - Use the `<picture>` element to serve differently sized images at the three breakpoints
    - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has a lot of great images if you need some
  - Use the `pointer:course` media query to detect touch devices
  - <i>hint:</i> while it's not necessary, try hosting your images on [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) like I demonstrated in the Zoom (at around 01:07:00 in the recording)
    - This will make it easier to serve different size images with different crops just via the URL

<b>Due Date:</b> Uploaded to your Github repo and accessible via a link on your course homepage by next lab, April 24
