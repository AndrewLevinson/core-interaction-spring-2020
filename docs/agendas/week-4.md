## Lab

### Friday, 2/14

- Week 4 Student Presentation (Arianne)
- [Lesson 4: CSS Layout (continued)](../lessons/lab/lesson-4)

### Homework

1. Create a newspaper homepage layout using CSS Grid!

- Things to keep in mind:
  - Only create the paper's homepage; article links should just go no where `<a href="#">example</a>`
  - Make sure to use flexible units when defining your `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` (i.e., `repeat(5, 1fr)`) and make your container responsive as well (using `vh` and `vw` or percentages instead of `px`). The more it feels like a real digital newspaper the better.
  - Use the CSS styling you already know in addition to css grid to make it look nice!
  - Need help?
