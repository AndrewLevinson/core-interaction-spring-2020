### Homework

- Create a brand new page with your own CSS animations! This can be a series of smaller animations or a single larger animation, but make sure you:
  - Include instructions on the page for interactions if necessary (<i>hover over the box to see it spin, etc.</i>)
  - Use both types of css animation techniques:
    - 1. `transition`
    - 2. `animation` with `@keyframes`
  - Animate as many properties as you want but be sure to at least include `transform` and `opacity` changes
  - Include [CSS variables](../lessons/lab/lesson-5b) for things like colors and animation properties
  - <b>bonus challenge</b>: animate a pseudo-element like `::after` or `::before`

<i>Need help? check out our week 5 lessons, the MDN docs for [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) and [animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) and reference Andrew's in-class Codepens listed on the [instructor site README.md](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato)</i>
