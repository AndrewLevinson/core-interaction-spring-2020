# Week 9 Agenda

### Study Week! No Class Meetings

## Studio

- See Simone's Email from Monday, March 23

## Lab

1. See JavaScript Archive tutorial where I pull together everything we've learned so far it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript up through week 8. It’s simple but organized, which is what you should strive for on your projects:

- [Live Site](https://andrewlevinson.github.io/symmetrical-octo-potato/lab/week-8/index.html)
- [Code with comments](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato/tree/master/lab/week-8)

2. Our "Present a Website to the Class" series has been moved to an online canvas discussion

- See [discussion](https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1482839/discussion_topics/5754964) on canvas
- <b>Post due by April 10th</b>

3. Instead of meeting as a class April 3rd, I’m planning on doing 1-on-1 check-ins with everyone individually. Please sign-up for a slot for next friday, April 3 on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1PL634d3rfS5E1W3sgERc2jp_HkfVuywtuTEasO0h1YU/edit?usp=sharing)
