# The Developer Environment

## Getting Set Up

1. Download Google Chrome. We will use it the entire semester. Mozilla Firefox is also acceptable. Don't even think about Safari though. We will talk about why later in the semester.
1. Download a free text editor. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Open the Terminal on your Mac

   - talk to me if you have a Windows PC instead; we will work through any Windows specific operations

1. Create a [Github Account](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one) and create a new repository for this course.
1. Install [Git version control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Generate an SSH Key to add to your Github following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## Using the Terminal and Git

If you wanted to, you could do just about anything you can imagine in the terminal without ever using a GUI. However, we're going to keep it simple. The below commands for the Terminal and for Git are likely all you will need in this course...and likely in life.

### Top Terminal Commands

```shell
# Go Home
~

## Current Directory
pwd

# Change Directory
cd path/to/directory

# Listing Directory
ls

# Open current folder in terminal
open .
# Open file
open ./path/to/filename

# Create a Directory (folder)
mkdir directory-name

# Create an empty file
touch index.html
```

### Top Git Commands

```git

# initialize Git tracking on folder (and children)
git init

# clone repo
git clone git@github.com:repo-name

# check status - use this between ALL commands (seriously!)
git status

# add file
git add file-name
# add all files
git add .

# commit
git commit -m"custom commit message describing your changes"

# Push your changes to remote repository (your github repo)
git push origin branch-name

# Stash changes
git stash

# see local branches
git branch

# switch to another branch
git checkout branch-name

# create and go to new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Merge another branch into your current branch
git merge branch-name

# help!
git help

```

## README.md

- Let's add and push a `README.md` file to your new repository :tada:
- But first, what is `Markdown` ?
