# Responsive Design, Part 2

This week we'll cover remaining pieces of responsive design, along with some guidence on working with media in HTML/CSS/JS

- Go over how to ask for help. You must be code formating with prettier (show signs), you MUST be coding with the console open and tracking down error. Emphasize, if you ask me for help and your code has console errors and mistakes like missing commas, brackets, parenthesis, etc., I can't help you. Nothing will work until that is sorted first.
- Cover how to know if something is a touch device

- re-emphasize layout and staying away from absolute positioning when you can. most layouts flow fluidly
- overflow
- object-fit stuff
- Working with video and audio
- CDN links?
- position: sticky (and other positions)
