# Intro to SVG!

:::tip What is SVG?
<i>"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and SMIL. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.</i>

<i>SVG images and their related behaviors are defined in XML text files, which means they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.</i>

<i>Compared to classic bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality and can be easily localized by updating the text within them, without the need of a graphical editor to do so. With proper libraries, SVG files can even be localized on-the-fly."</i>

SVG is essentially just text that describes basic 2-D shapes. And that 'text' content can be used in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's why it's lossless. It's always why it's awesome for illustration, interactivity, and animation.

## Let's Go Step-By-Step

1. #### How do we get our hands on an svg?
   - We can make them in design software
   - We can write code to generate them
   - We can use open-source resources to download and use them
2. #### How do we use svg?
   - There's actually a lot of ways, we'll cover two:
     1. inside an `<img/>` tag
     2. inline in our HTML
3. #### How do we interact with an svg element?
   - Review of CSS with SVG
4. #### How do we animate with svg?
   - CSS transitions and keyframes
   - JavaScript Libraries
   - [SMIL - built-into SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL)
