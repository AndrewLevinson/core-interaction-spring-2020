HTML and CSS: Structure and tags, media, the box model, selectors and specificity; Text editor goodness

1. Review basic folder structure and hierarchy for course repo. (review a few other good examples in the wild? open source stuff)
2. I will add HTML to my course site as the class watches. Students can call out elements they want me to add.
   - Emphasize this is not comprehensive, they can learn that on their own but these are just some ideas. Pepper in VScode shortcuts.
   - Show indentation, proper html:5 scafold
   - Add 2 headers, an image (local and remote)
   - Add media. local and remote. gif, video, image, audio
   - proper semantic (explain) tags. nav, section, main, header, footer. Before divs.

CSS
