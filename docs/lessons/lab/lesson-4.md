## But first, some more dev tools

### VS Code

- [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for _hot reloading_ :fire:
  - No more manual refreshing!
- [Launch VS Code from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) by typing `code .` in terminal.

  - No more drag and drop!

### Codepen

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is a great tool for rapid coding when an idea hits you

  ::: warning Using CodePen in Class
  You may use CodePen for your in-class exercises but <b>I need to be able to find them</b>. Please add a link to your CodePen (make sure it works) in a `markdown.md` file in your `Lab` sub-folder of your course repository.

# Layout and Positioning

## Advanced Positioning

::: tip Activity! Mondrian
Create a [Mondrian](https://www.google.com/search?q=mondrian+layout&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS720US720&sxsrf=ACYBGNSqRbQMunUGuJ9eafsv3Hm4dfnVeg:1581699889166&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjls6Ogw9HnAhVjg-AKHRr7DI0Q_AUoAXoECA4QAw&biw=1440&bih=722) <b>without</b> flexbox or grid. Only use `position` and `transform` in CSS.

## Layout in CSS

There are plenty of ways to create a layout in CSS, from hacky old-school `float` to modern css grid. We are going to familiarize ourselves with the modern approaches like `display: flex` and `display: grid` as these are the most powerful techniques to building a beautiful site.

### Flexbox

::: tip Review Homework
How did everyone enjoy [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)?
Let's do a few examples!
:::

### CSS Grid

::: tip Activity! CSS Grid
By the same makers of Flexbox Froggy, comes [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/). Let's work through of few of these as a class to understand `CSS Grid`. It is more complex, but much more powerful, than Flexbox.
:::

::: tip Activity!
Let's rebuild our Mondrian with Grid. Take some time on your own to try. Andrew will rebuild at front of class and take questions.

### Layout Fun

:::tip Get Started on Homework!
Let's have some fun with layout to create a newspaper front page. Use transforms and positions, display: flex, and display: grid to create 3 different layouts that are thematically the same. Create a `.md` file that explains your process and how the 3 different approaches compared to each other. What was easier? What was harder? Which do you prefer?
