# Exploring Basic JavaScript

First, the [weird history of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4)

Javascript is a flexible language. This can be helpful or confusing depending on how look at it. Some of JS is imperative (for loops) and some is declarative (array methods). This will make sense later.

In this class, we'll learn through tutorials and live coding sessions. They will be feature-driven as opposed to language-driven. We will also start with <i>vanilla</i> JavaScript without jQuery to avoid any confusion. We'll introduce libraries formally in later classes—but if you are comfortable, feel free to use them now.

### Recap

With Simone, you've [learned](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G9JlCkrOPEGd8LrOAVebjPf4dBk2xmf3goXDfB_UscI/edit?usp=sharing):

- How to include a `script` via a tag in your `html` file, or as an external script linked from your `html` file (very similar to CSS in `<head>` vs. external stylesheet)
- The console and `console.log` method
- Primitives like strings, numbers booleans, objects, and arrays
- How to define a variable
- Operators (+, –, etc.)
- Indexing an array (`myArray[0]`)
- Functions

### Let's do a walk through of dynamic content manipulation in JavaScript

#### Objectives to cover over the next two weeks:

- Manipulating existing static content vs. generating dynamic content
  - Static content = elements written in `HTML` manually
  - Dynamic content = using data (i.e., a list of image sources) to create `HTML` elements
- Randomizing
- Using HTML elements with JavaScript like buttons, sliders, dropdowns, etc.
- How to use someone elses code + code commenting (learn how to NOT plagiarize!)

#### What parts of the language we need to learn to meet our objectives:

- Selecting elements from the document (HTML = document)
- working with array and (maybe) objects
- using JavaScript's built-in array methods manipulate and generate content
  - What's the difference between iteration with a method and looping? Why use one vs. the other?
- setting the `innerHTML` of an element to set your generated/manipulated content
- template literals
- `Math.random()` and array shuffling for randomization
- JavaScript events like onClick

Check at the README file on [Andrew's Site](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato) for our in-class coding examples. I'll maintain this throughout the semester so be sure to check when you need help remembering what we did in class
