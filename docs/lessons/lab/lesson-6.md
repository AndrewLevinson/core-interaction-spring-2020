# Intro to JavaScript

### ideas:

- explain JS. JS vs. jQuery. Build on slides. Iteration, data structure. Dynamic content. Random.
- Imperative vs. Declarative JS
  - Imperative is spelling out everything you want the program to do (for loops)
  - Declarative is just saying what you want to accomplish (array methods)

1. Explain how we're going to learn JS

   - Some exers.
   - objective-based coding tutorials
   - Follow along

2. console, console.log, variables, data types, storage(objects, arrays), build in methods, template literals, iteration vs. loop, functions, adding elements to html, dom manipulation (querySelectors, innerHTML)

3. Extra resources to follow. Check [Andrew's Site](https://github.com/AndrewLevinson/symmetrical-octo-potato) for our in-class coding examples

4. Walk through. Let's

- Homework? Review the in-class example and please come in with specific javascript questions. Next week we will add interactive elements like button, dropdowns, and sliders to our HTML and learn how to use JavaScript to make them work!
