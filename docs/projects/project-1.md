# It's Alive!

- project details

### Description

Read the first chapter of ‘Things: A Story of the Sixties by George Perec’ and the summary of the Language from ‘Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language’. Decided which of the two readings you want to focus on and translate the words into an online website. Week by week, using first HTML, consequently CSS you will translate the printed words of the book into a published website. Your reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story. You may use one page or multiple pages to convey this experience.

### Due Date(s)
