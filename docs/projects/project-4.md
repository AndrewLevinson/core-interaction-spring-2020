# E-Reader

We will collect all the readings of this class, into an online publications. 
In additional to the reading, we will add: 

- Your weekly question
- Your pair presentation

Every Tuesday, one person will be selected to answer three questions from the class about the readings. Every question will become part of the online publication. 

Every Thursday, two people will be selected to present the readings for that day. The pair needs to present the reading in a format of a ‘publication’ (4 pages total). It’s totally up to you how you want to summarize and design these 4 pages. You can use: images, text, video, GIF, hyperlink, websites, etc. These 4 pages will be added to our online publications. You don’t need to send me the presentation before class. I will need the 4 pages the day after your presentation. 

By the end of the semester, I will export the E-Reader for you.
