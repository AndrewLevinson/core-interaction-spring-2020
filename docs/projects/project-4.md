# E-Reader

We will collect all the readings of this class, into an online publications. 
In additional to the reading, we will add: 

- Your weekly question
- Your pair presentation

Every Tuesday, one person will be selected to answer three questions from the class about the readings. Every question will become part of the online publication. 

Every Thursday, two people will be selected to present the readings for that day. The pair needs to present the reading in a format of a book (4 pages total). Itâ€™s up to them how they want to summarize the reading. You can use: images, text, video, GIF, hyperlink, websites, etc. This 4 pages will be added to our online publications. 

By the end of the semester, I will export the E-Reader for all of you.
